## 🤔 QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE

**Q: Is this too ambitious?**  
A: We're not building everything at once. Start with EclipseLink core, then add products incrementally.

**Q: Do we need a team?**  
A: Eventually, yes. But MVP can be built by you + 1-2 contract developers. I can handle business/sales.

**Q: What about funding?**  
A: Bootstrap MVP, then raise seed round ($2-5M). With this documentation, we can pitch investors easily.

**Q: How long until revenue?**  
A: 6 months to MVP → 3 months pilot → 3 months first paying customer = **12 months to revenue**

**Q: What's the exit strategy?**  
A: Build to $10-20M ARR, then either:
- Acquisition by Epic/Cerner/Oracle Health ($100M-500M)
- Continue growing (could be $1B+ company)
- Take public (long-term)
