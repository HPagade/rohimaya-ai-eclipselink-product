## Slide 1: TITLE SLIDE

# ⚡ EclipseLink AI™

**Saving Lives Through Better Communication**

Voice-Enabled Clinical Handoff Platform
with AI-Powered SBAR Generation

**Rohimaya Health AI**
HIPAA Compliant | Enterprise-Ready | AI-Powered

## Slide 2: THE CRISIS

# 250,000 Americans Die Each Year
## from Preventable Medical Errors

**3rd Leading Cause of Death** in the United States

### The Handoff Problem:
- 📊 **80%** of serious medical errors involve miscommunication during handoffs
- ⏰ **2-3 hours per shift** spent by nurses on handoff documentation
- ⚠️ **40%** of handoffs are incomplete
- 💰 **$17 billion** annual cost from handoff-related errors

**SOURCE:** Johns Hopkins Medicine, Joint Commission, NEJM

---

## Slide 3: REAL-WORLD IMPACT

# What Happens When Handoffs Fail

### Case Study: ICU Transfer
**Patient:** 67-year-old cardiac patient
**Scenario:** Incomplete handoff during shift change
**Missing Info:** Recent medication change
**Result:** Drug interaction → cardiac arrest

### The Cost:
- **Patient Outcome:** Preventable death
- **Hospital Cost:** $2.5M malpractice settlement
- **Staff Impact:** Emotional trauma, burnout
- **System Failure:** Broken communication process

**This happens EVERY DAY in US hospitals.**

---

## Slide 4: CURRENT SOLUTIONS ARE BROKEN

# Why Existing Tools Fail

| Method | Problem | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Paper Charts** | Lost, illegible, incomplete | High error rate |
| **EHR Documentation** | 15-20 min to complete | Low compliance |
| **Verbal Only** | No record, no accountability | Legal risk |
| **Generic Messaging** | Not structured for clinical use | Missed critical info |

### The Gap:
❌ **NO SOLUTION** combines voice input, AI generation, and structured SBAR format

**Until Now.**

---

## Slide 5: INTRODUCING ECLIPSELINK AI

# The Future of Clinical Handoffs

## How It Works:

### Step 1: SPEAK (60 seconds)
🎤 Clinician records voice handoff using phone or tablet

### Step 2: TRANSCRIBE (30 seconds)
🤖 Azure Whisper AI converts speech to text with medical accuracy

### Step 3: GENERATE (30 seconds)
📋 GPT-4 creates structured SBAR report automatically

### Step 4: REVIEW & COMPLETE (30 seconds)
✅ Clinician reviews, edits if needed, and completes handoff

**Total Time: 2.5 minutes** (vs 20 minutes manual)

---

## Slide 6: LIVE DEMO

# See It In Action

### [INTERACTIVE DEMO]

**Demo Highlights:**
1. Voice recording with real-time timer
2. AI transcription display
3. Automatic SBAR generation
4. Quality scoring (completeness, critical elements)
5. PDF export and audit trail

**Demo URL:** [demo.eclipselink.ai](http://demo.eclipselink.ai)

---

## Slide 7: THE SBAR FRAMEWORK

# Clinical Gold Standard

## SBAR = Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation

### Why SBAR?
- ✅ **Endorsed by Joint Commission** and IHI
- ✅ **Reduces errors by 30-50%** (peer-reviewed studies)
- ✅ **Universal format** taught in nursing and medical schools
- ✅ **Structured communication** ensures nothing is missed

### EclipseLink AI Advantage:
**First platform to AUTO-GENERATE SBAR from voice**

No manual formatting. No training required. Just speak naturally.

---

## Slide 8: AI-POWERED QUALITY

# Not Just Transcription — Intelligence

### Quality Scoring Engine:
1. **Completeness Score** — Are all SBAR sections filled?
2. **Critical Elements Score** — Patient ID, allergies, meds, vitals?
3. **Overall Quality Grade** — A, B, C, D rating

### Real-Time Feedback:
- ⚠️ **Alert:** "Missing patient allergies — please add"
- ⚠️ **Alert:** "No vital signs mentioned — verify current status"
- ✅ **Success:** "High-quality handoff — all critical elements present"

### Continuous Learning:
- AI improves from every handoff
- Custom models per hospital specialty
- Learns institutional terminology
