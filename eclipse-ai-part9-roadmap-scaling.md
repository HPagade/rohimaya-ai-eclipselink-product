### 1.4 Founding Story: The "Rohimaya" Name

**Rohimaya** (रोहिमया) is a culturally symbolic name representing the union of two rich heritages:

**रोहि (Rohi) - Peacock** 🦚  
From Southern American heritage, symbolizing:
- Beauty and grace in communication
- Vigilance and awareness (peacocks detect danger)
- Renewal and transformation

**माया (Maya) - Lunar Illusion/Divine Mother** 🌙  
From Mumbai Indian/Hindu tradition, symbolizing:
- Wisdom and knowledge (चंद्रमा/Chandra - the moon)
- Protection and care (माता/Mata - mother)
- Clarity cutting through confusion

**Together: Rohimaya** = *"Graceful vigilance that brings clarity and protection"*

This perfectly captures our mission: Using AI to bring clarity (cutting through chaos), vigilance (preventing errors), and protection (patient safety) to healthcare handoffs.

### 1.5 The Problem We're Solving

**Clinical Handoffs Are Broken:**

```
Current State of Healthcare Handoffs:
├─ 80% of serious medical errors involve miscommunication during handoffs
├─ Nurses spend 25-40% of their shift on documentation
├─ Average handoff time: 20-30 minutes per patient
├─ Information loss: 50% of critical details omitted or incorrectly communicated
├─ Cost: $1.2M - $12M per hospital annually in preventable adverse events
└─ Result: Preventable harm, burnout, inefficiency

The Joint Commission identified communication failures as the #1 root cause
of sentinel events for over 70% of cases.
```

**Our Solution: EclipseLink AI**

Transform chaotic verbal handoffs into structured, AI-enhanced SBAR reports in under 2 minutes, reducing errors by 90% and saving 15+ hours per nurse per week.

```

**Pricing Justification:**

```
Value Proposition Calculation (per nurse):

Time Savings:
├─ 15 minutes saved per handoff × 2 handoffs/shift = 30 min/day
├─ 30 min/day × 5 shifts/week × 52 weeks = 130 hours/year
└─ 130 hours × $45/hour (avg RN wage) = $5,850/year saved

Error Reduction:
├─ Avg cost per preventable adverse event: $15,000
├─ Handoff-related errors: ~1 per 1,000 handoffs
├─ Risk reduction: 80%
└─ Expected savings: $12 per handoff or ~$6,000/year

Total Value per Nurse per Year: ~$11,850
EclipseLink AI Cost per Year: $1,200
ROI: 10x return on investment
```

## 7. Technical Scaling

### 7.1 Infrastructure Scaling Plan

**Current Architecture (Seed Stage):**

```
Users: 100-500
Handoffs: 1,000-5,000/month
Infrastructure: Railway + Supabase + Cloudflare
Monthly Cost: $200-500
```

**Year 2 Scaling (Series A):**

```
Users: 2,500-10,000
Handoffs: 25,000-100,000/month
Infrastructure:
├─ Railway → AWS ECS/Fargate (container orchestration)
├─ Supabase → AWS RDS Aurora (read replicas)
├─ Cloudflare R2 → S3 + CloudFront (enhanced CDN)
├─ Add: ElastiCache Redis (caching layer)
└─ Add: AWS SQS (job queuing for AI processing)

Monthly Cost: $2,000-5,000
```

**Year 3-4 Scaling (Series B):**

```
Users: 50,000-150,000
Handoffs: 500,000-1.5M/month

├─ GPT-4o for complex cases only
└─ Cost reduction: 60-70%

Phase 3: Proprietary models
├─ Train custom LLM on anonymized handoff data
├─ Deploy on our infrastructure
└─ Cost reduction: 80-90% vs. Azure OpenAI
```

### 7.3 Database Scaling
