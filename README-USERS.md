## üåç Our Mission

### Why We Built EclipseLink

**Hannah Kraulik Pagade, RN, CEO & Co-Founder:**

> "After 15 years as a nurse, I watched countless colleagues burn out from endless documentation. I watched medical errors happen because critical information got lost in handoffs. I watched families wait anxiously for updates while nurses were too busy charting to call them.
> 
> So I learned to code. I got my Computer Science degree. And I built the handoff tool I always wished existed.
> 
> EclipseLink isn't about technology for technology's sake. It's about giving you more time with your patients. It's about reducing errors. It's about leaving work on time.
> 
> Because healthcare workers deserve tools that work for them, not against them."

### The Rohimaya Story

**Rohimaya** blends:
- **Rohi** (Phoenix) - Rebirth and transformation of healthcare
- **Maya** (Peacock) - Protection and watchful care of patients
- **Rohini** (Moon constellation) - Guidance through darkness

We honor both founders' heritages:
- Hannah's Southern American background
- Prasad's Mumbai Indian roots

Our mission: **Rebirth ‚Ä¢ Protection ‚Ä¢ Guidance** for healthcare
